# Linear-Rgression-model-for-fish-dataset
The fish dataset is been used analysis.In which dependent variable is weigth of fish.following are the process
1)EDA is done for dataset to clean the dataset and removing the outliers
2)checking the multicollinearity
3)Then storing dependent feature in y and independent features in x.
4)spliting the x and y into training and testing data.
5)Creating a model using x_train and y_train
6)predicting the y value in model using x_test
7)Evaluating the model by R2_score using y_test values and predicted y value
